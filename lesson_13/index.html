						Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
						looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
						<span class="underline">their own section</span>. Continue reading
						for an introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React,
						and more!

					<p>
						React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
						iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native
						capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
						platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
						of your UI using React components:
						<s style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: none"
							>of reusable, nestable code.</s
						>
						You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s
						cover how components work in React Native.

					<p>
						React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular
						open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To
						make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
						This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
					</p>
					<p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
					<p>
						<span style="font-weight: 700">+ components.</span> The rest of this
						introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
						approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="font-weight: 700">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native
						use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
						like so:<mark
							>&#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your cat!&#60;&#8725;Text&#62;.</mark
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						The React docs have
						<span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
						refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
						variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark>name</mark> for
						the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
						<mark>&#60;Text&#62;</mark>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="font-weight: 700">+ props.</span> Props is short for
						“properties”.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="font-weight: 700">+ state.</span> While you can think
						of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
						state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful
						for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
						interaction. State gives your components memory!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-box">
					<span class="line"></span>
					<h2 id="hand" class="bar-style no-line">
						handling text input<span class="super">Chapter 4</span>
					</h2>
					<p>
						TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
						has an
						<s style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: none"
							>onChangeText</s
						>
						prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed,
						and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when
						the text is submitted.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
						their words into a different language. In this new language, every
						single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence
						"Hello there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829; &#127829;".
